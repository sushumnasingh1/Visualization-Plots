# Scatter Plot
A scatter plot uses dots to represent values for two different numeric variables. The position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis indicates values for an individual data point. Scatter plots are used to observe relationships between variables. This scatter plot is showing number of people having COVID-19 in different districts in year 2021

# Box Plot
A box plot is a chart that shows data from a five-number summary including one of the measures of central tendency. It does not show the distribution in particular as much as a stem and leaf plot or histogram does. But it is primarily used to indicate a distribution is skewed or not and if there are potential unusual observations (also called outliers) present in the data set. this figure has two box plots  first one is for  number of deaths due to COVID in different districts and second plot is for showing the distribution of recovered cases.

# Bar Plot
A bar chart or bar graph is a chart or graph that presents categorical data with rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the values that they represent. This bar plot is showing number of people died due to COVID-19 in different districts in year 2021.
